Hi, my name is James and this is my learning diary for CASA0023: Remote Sensing Cities and Environments. I am a postgraduate student current undertaking a MSc in Urban Spatial Science at The Barlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (with an expected graduation date of August 2024). My other interests include hiking, drone piloting/photography, cycling, cooking and board games.
