# Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)

In the final week of content, we covered Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) fundamentals such as polarisation, amplitutde, phase, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR). We also covered change detection and the use of t-test to observe if such changes are significant.

## Summary

There are two types of sensors: passive and active [@gisgeography2015]. Passive sensors measure electromagnetic radiation from the sun that is reflected by the earth. Passive sensors are present on Landsat and MODIS satellites. On the other hand, active sensors have their own energy source where they actively emit a pulse and measure the signal that is reflected from the earth. An example of an active sensor is Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR).

SAR obtains its name from combining a sequence of images from a shorter antenna to provide an image with higher spatial resolution [@nasa2020]. The spatial resolution of data is dependent on the ratio of the sensor wavelength to the length of the sensor’s antenna (ibid). However, it is unfeasible to have a long antenna in space, thus leading to the above solution to ‘synthesize’ a long antenna.

The different wavelength for SAR determines its interaction with the earth’s surface and its capability to penetrate into a medium. An X-band with a shorter wavelength is unlikely to penetrate through thick vegetation and hence mainly interacts with the tree canopy whereas an L band is able to penetrate through and allow for backscattering from the branches and trunks below. A summary of the bands, wavelengths and applications of SAR are as follow:

Besides wavelengths, another consideration is polarisation which refers to “the orientation of the plane in which the transmitted electromagnetic wave oscillates” [@nasa2020]. SAR sensors can transmit signals in the horizontal (H) or vertical (V) polarisation and likewise receive them in either the horizontal (H) or vertical (V). As different surfaces are more sensitive or respond differently to the polarisations (VV, VH, HV, HH), analysing the signal strength in these polarisations can provide insight into the structure of the observed surface.

Referring to the image above

1.  Strong scattering in the [VV polarisation]{.underline} indicates a predominance of rough scattering. This suggests the presence of surfaces with coarse textures such as bare earth and rough water surfaces.
2.  Strong scattering in the [VH or HV polarisation]{.underline} (i.e. cross polarisation) indicates sensitivity to volume scattering. This implies the dominance of volumetric features such as dense vegetation, in particular leaves and branches.
3.  Strong scattering in the [HH polarisation]{.underline}, signifies a tendency towards double bounce scattering. This indicates the presence of features that cause a double bounce effect, such as buildings, tree trunks and calm water surfaces.

The interpretation of SAR images is not the most straightforward. The Alaska Satellite Facility conceptualised some rule of thumb on interpreting different features. For more information, read @alaskasatellitefacility2019.

## Application

This week’s tutorial was one of my favourite which used SAR to perform a change detection of the Beirut port explosion in 2020 using Sentinel 1 image. SAR is useful for such tasks as it is able to detect subtle changes in amplitude and phase of radar wave reflection due to building damages, which are not easily observable in visible light imagery [@nasa2020a].

The image needs to be filtered for its ascending and descending orbit, as the satellite views the earth’s surface from different angles. The t-test can then be calculated for each orbit to examine if the change observed is statistically significant before the results are combined into a single image. The t-test involves comparing images in the year before the explosion to establish a baseline and images two months after the explosion to capture the explosion effects, while excluding reconstruction efforts. Validation using building footprint data was then performed to check if the extent of the damage was accurately predicted. The end result shows the number of damaged buildings was 9256, which was close to UN’s estimate of 10000 buildings. An explanation for this underestimation is that the satellite image provides a top-down point of view of the buildings. However, some buildings could still be standing with their roof intact, yet receive damage at the sides which are not captured by the satellite.

Another use of SAR is for oil spill detection [@chen2017]. SAR is suitable for this task due to its wide coverage and all-weather conditions. Earlier studies focused on using single polarimetric SAR images, where oil slicks appear as dark areas due to the suppression of Bragg scattering from the ocean surface. However, distinguishing oil spills from other phenomena like biogenic slicks posed challenges. Various studies proposed other polarimetric features to classify oil spills such as standard deviation of copolarised phase difference, pedestrial height and copolarisation ratio. @chen2017 applied deep learning algorithms to optimise polarimetric feature sets for oil spill detection based on the 2011 Norwegian oil-on-water exercise. Their approach outperformed other methods such as support vector machine and artificial neural networks in distinguishing between different types of slicks. Overall, this study shows that SAR can be useful for obtaining more information about different surfaces and distinguish them based on their properties, along with the integration of machine learning to improve classification problems.

Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is an extension of SAR which combines multiple SAR images acquired from slightly different positions and times to create interferograms [@usgsc]. It can be used to study ground deformation such as at volcanic areas [@schaefer2016]. InSAR offers advantages over field monitoring, such as lower cost, lower risk and the ability to detect subtle ground deformation near volcanic areas that may not be easily observable. It also boasts high spatial resolution and continuous monitoring capabilities. By utilising InSAR for post-eruption of Pacaya volcano in Guatemala in 2010, subsidence and deformation can be detected. This information can contribute to understanding the stability of the volcano and aid in hazard assessment. UASVAR and ALOS-1 were used as complementary datasets to analyse activities before the eruptions, their evolution and the impact on the surrounding terrain. Beyond volcanic monitoring, in the field of earth observation and geoscience, InSAR can be used to study earthquakes and glaciers using similar methodologies. which follow the same methodology.

There are just so many applications of SAR. The @alaskasatellitefacility2019a has compiled the following map which shows the different uses of SAR around the world.

## Reflection

SAR was quite an interesting topic to read about as compared to other satellites. There were more considerations such as polarisation, or whether the satellite was on an ascending or descending orbits. I was also fascinated by the various uses cases of SAR such as land subsidence, damage assessment, and its applications in archaeology. This made me wonder, given SAR’s valuable information and advantages, why is it avoided at times or considered disadvantageous?

From the practical and through other readings, SAR images generally require more processing, for example, considering polarisation and the orbit direction. They cannot be visually interpreted easily like an image and may suffer from information loss due to shadow [@um2021]. Additionally, SAR cannot be used to calculate various spectral indices directly, such as NDVI, as it operates in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum and measures backscatter to the Earth. In other words, it cannot capture the spectral properties of various materials [@mazza2018].

This reflection marks the end of the course. I think I come a long way in learning about remote sensing back in 2018 in my penultimate year of undergraduate, where I was exposed to ENVI and ArcGIS and limited to the lab computers. It is amazing how I was able to run all the practical from the past weeks on my personal device and that data is more accessible. The range of techniques and topics covered in this course was broader, encompassing classification, change detection, machine learning and different satellites. Remote sensing is a really exciting field and I hope to apply it to more projects in the future.

Also special shout-outs to my profs for their amazing lectures and practicals. Their resources can be found at @maclachlan2024 and @ballinger2024.
