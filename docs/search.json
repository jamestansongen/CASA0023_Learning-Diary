    "text": "4.1 Summary\nAccording to a CDP report on cities at risk of climate change (https://www.cdp.net/en/research/global-reports/cities-at-risk), the top five hazards that cities face include flooding, heat waves, rain storms, extreme hot days and droughts. Los Angeles is no stranger to such hazards, such as flooding. In February 2024, Los Angeles, along with other parts of California, faced a rare Level 4 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall (https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/04/us/california-atmospheric-river-flooding/index.html). This threat level means that the city is facing “life threatening flash and urban flash flooding”, in this case due to atmospheric rivers. In the first quarter of 2023, it was estimated that flooding caused approximately $30 billion in damages to the state of California (https://cleanfax.com/california-flooding-damage-estimates-top-30b/).\nLos Angeles, in order to better manage its water-related resources and hazards released the One Water LA 2040 Plan in 2018 (https://www.lacitysan.org/cs/groups/sg_owla/documents/document/y250/mdmx/~edisp/cnt031540.pdf) . The Metropolitan outlined seven goals of which Goal 6 of “Increas[ing] climate resilience by planning for climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies in all City actions” is related to flooding. In terms of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), this is related mainly to “Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities” of making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable, along with “Goal 13: Climate Action” to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts (https://sdgs.un.org/goals).\nThe city’s stormwater planning approach aims for projects that improve water quality, augment water supply and mitigate flood risks. These include distributed and regional green infrastructure projects, that differ based on scale. The former nature-based solutions include bioretention cells, bioswales, catch basin retrofits while the latter includes capture-storage-use systems and nature-inspired-flow-through treatment wetlands. In addition, the city has plans to implement more grey infrastructure projects such as canals and reservoirs.\nSummary of Stormwater Projects as detailed in the One Water LA 2040 Plan Summary Report. Source:\nHowever, critics argue that Los Angeles’ water management strategy overly relies on grey infrastructure to quickly flush water away, neglecting the potential benefits of green infrastructure projects to absorb and store water (The parched metropolis: can eco architecture save LA from megadrought? | Architecture | The Guardian) as green infrastructure are seen to be 50% more cost effective than grey infrastructure (https://www.weforum.org/press/2022/01/biodivercities-initiative-set-to-transform-global-urban-infrastructure-by-2030/). In Los Angeles, even when green infrastructure projects are proposed, there are further concerns that they may not be equitably distributed or planned in locations with the ideal conditions for groundwater infiltration (Evaluating Equity Under Measure W – Los Angeles County’s Safe Clean Water Program — Institute of the Environment and Sustainability at UCLA).\nTo address these challenges, remote sensing could be a valuable tool for policy planning in the placement of nature-based solutions. The overall workflow would require a stocktake of the city’s green and blue infrastructure or the ability of areas to absorb water, followed by overlaying it with flood data to identify areas to implement nature-based solutions. Further extensions can be added to ensure partnership with different stakeholders and meet other SDGs.",

    "text": "4.2 Application\nIn 2023, Arup released the Global Sponge Cities Snapshot report to examine how “spongy” 10 cities are which relates to their ability to harvest and store water (https://www.arup.com/perspectives/publications/research/section/global-sponge-cities-snapshot). Its methodology to produce such a snapshot involved quantifying the amount of blue, green and grey infrastructure through machine learning of satellite imagery. Arup subsequently considered the quantity of each major hydrological soil type in each city before calculating the surface runoff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArup’s methodology to calculate the city’s sponge snapshot. Source:\nTo reproduce such a snapshot, the followship steps are required:\nStep 1: Quantifying city’s blue, green and grey infrastructure.\nSentinel 2 or other remote sensing images can be obtained for the metropolitan area. Supervised classification or machine learning can be employed in order to classify the different land cover such as water bodies, vegetation, buildings, roads, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimelapse of Sentinel 2 images of Los Angeles. Source:\nStep 2: Soil types and vegetation\nThe next step would be to factor in the soil type which would influence ground permeability and porosity. Hyperspectral imaging of the topsoil, combined with regression modelling, can be used to estimate the percentage of sand and clay in a bare field (https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/20/3312). This can be done through the use of the visible and near-infrared bands to create a soil moisture map.\nStep 3: Water runoff potential\nA digital elevation model (DEM) can be used to generate the slope profile for Los Angeles. Through combining with land use and soil type, the water runoff potential for the area can be estimated (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S034181621400109X?casa_token=g47IvUwfNQcAAAAA:O-hHGlUuhEX5V3zstsFibGAxf58RfdGqNZqv9p7wzqvG_f_vvvTj9SqvqsKF92hzrKEnvZ636tw).\nThrough Steps (1) to (3), by quantifying the city’s blue, green and grey infrastructure, factoring in the soil type and vegetation and water runoff potential, an index or map of the city’s ability to absorb and store water can be obtained. With the map, the idea is for authorities to understand the city’s profile and make better informed decisions in the implementation of nature-based solutions (https://www.arup.com/perspectives/publications/research/section/global-sponge-cities-snapshot). As an extension of Arup’s sponge snapshot, the following are other considerations to enhance authorities’ efforts in dealing with floods.\nConsideration A: Flood maps\nTo obtain accurate and up-to-date flood maps, the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images can be used (https://www-tandfonline-com.libproxy.ucl.ac.uk/doi/abs/10.1080/01431160010014729). Even if the satellite overpass may not coincide with the flood peak, integrating the map of inundated areas obtained through SAR with digital topographic data can help estimate flooded areas. Through overlaying the flood maps with the city’s sponge snapshot, authorities are able to identify areas affected severely by floods and with low capacity to store water as a priority area for intervention. Alternatively, authorities are able to identify if there are any best practices in land use with regards to flood managements. This could possibly include large stretches of nature spaces that are able to hold water without inundating the surrounding areas.\nConsideration B: Local efforts to mitigate floods\nHomeowners in flood prone areas may take measures to floodproof their house such as elevating or dry flood-proofing their houses (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6850606/). It is possible that homeowners could undertake unauthorised or unpermitted changes in flood infrastructure such as constructing new concrete structure or encroachments into floodplains that may compromise authorities’ efforts. Change detection, by comparing satellite images of different time periods will allow authorities to monitor if any such development is occurring and react accordingly.\nConsideration C: Planning for connectivity, accessibility and liveability through space syntax\nIn addition to the SDG goals mentioned about sustainable cities and communities, and climate action, there is a potential to integrate the SDG goal of good health and well-being. Flood maps can be combined with spatial analysis techniques such as space syntax to provide insights into the connectivity, accessibility and spatial structure of urban area (http://spacesyntaxistanbul.itu.edu.tr/papers/longpapers/056%20-%20Dursun.pdf). Through integrating this data, authorities can ensure that the placement of nature-based solutions not only mitigate flooding but also contributing to creating more liveable environments such as more parks for people to enhance their quality of life.",

    "text": "4.3 Reflection\nThe above steps based on Arup’s report shows how remote sensing can be used to aid policymakers in creating a comprehensive map to make well-informed decisions on the areas most vulnerable to floods, best practices of areas that are able to mitigate flood effects, and possible areas to implement nature-based solutions. The addition of three other considerations shows that flooding is a complex issue with many other interconnected dimensions. This suggests that while remote sensing is valuable for policymakers, it is not a magic bullet. Stakeholders at different scales must be considered. Furthermore, for any measure implemented, it is essential to consider potential repercussions as well as possible opportunities such as liveability to integrate. Remote sensing is also not a one-off tool and can be used to periodically monitor the situation and effectiveness of measures implemented.\nAlthough remote sensing can be informative, it is important to recognise there may be challenges that limits its usage in policy. Challenges include the complexity of processing data, analysing results and communication findings, which may be more difficult for people to comprehend compared to simple charts and tables. To increase its use in policy, more collaboration and coordination among data providers, researchers, authorities and the general public is needed to harness it better.",

    "text": "1.1.1 Definition of Remote Sensing\nUSGS: Remote Sensing is the process of detecting and monitoring the physical characteristics of an area by measuring its reflected and emitted radiation at a distance (typically from satellite or aircraft) (USGS, n.d.).\nNASA: Remote sensing is acquiring of information from a distance. NASA observes Earth and other planetary bodies via remote sensors on satellites and aircraft that detect and record reflected or emitted energy (NASA, n.d.).\n\n\n1.1.2 Types of Resolution\n\nSpatial Resolution: the size of each pixel within a digital image and the area on Earth’s surface represented by that pixel (NASA, n.d.). A finer spatial resolution (or the smaller the number) means one is able to observe greater details while a coarser spatial resolution (or the bigger the number) means the image would be more pixelated as demonstrated below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCampus of the University of Maryland at College Park at 1m, 10m, 30m and 250m spatial resolution. Source: Liang and Wang (2020)\n\nTemporal Resolution: frequency at which a satellite revisits the same observation area (NASA, n.d.). Geostationary satellites orbit at the same rate of the earth and focus on the same observation area resulting in a higher temporal resolution. In contrast, polar orbiting satellites orbit around the entire Earth and able to observe the different parts of the world, at the cost of temporal resolution which could vary from 1 to 16 days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeostationary and Polar Orbiting Satellites. Source: Institute of Physics (n.d.)\n\nSpectral Resolution: the number and width of spectral bands in a sensor system (Liang and Wang 2020). Sensors which have more bands with narrower wavelengths, have finer spectral resolution. This would allow greater distinction to be made between various features such as rock or vegetation types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of spectral bands between Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 which have similar characteristics for the coastal aerosol (440 nm), visible (490-800 nm) and short-wave infrared or SWIR (1300-2400 nm) spectral bands.

Which one should I use?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of Landsat 8 vs. Sentinel 2 bands. Source: Ahady and Kaplan (2022)\nSentinel 2 performs better than Landsat 8 as it has better spatial resolution as seen from the pixel size column in the table above (Ahady and Kaplan 2022). It also has a better temporal resolution of ten days at the equator using one satellite, and five days using two satellites, under the assumption of cloud-free conditions (Sentinel Online, n.d.). In contrast, Landsat 8 has a temporal resolution of 16 days (Castaldi 2021).\nA study of both satellites in forest variable prediction shows that Sentinel 2 performed better than Landsat 8 in predictive accuracy, due to the former’s higher spatial resolution and additional red-edge bands (Astola et al. 2019). Sentinel 2 has four narrow bands in the red edge spectral domain which allows it to accurately study vegetation health or crop stress monitoring (Segarra et al. 2020).\nWhere Landsat 8 performs better is that it has thermal infrared sensors to measure surface temperature, a feature that Sentinel 2 does not possess (USGS, n.d.). This makes Landsat 8 suitable for studying processes such as the hydrologic cycle and climate change (Li et al. 2021). Landsat 8’s capabilities to measure land surface temperature also enables it to identify areas where the urban heat island effect is strongest in cities (Orusa and Mondino 2019).\nOverall, Sentinel-2 would be useful for looking at Land Use Land Cover (LULC) and vegetation related studies while Landsat 8 would be useful for studies related to urban heat island and climate change.",

    "text": "1.3 Reflection\nWhy can’t we develop a satellite that boast the best spatial, temporal, spectral and radiometric resolution, while also incorporating sensors for diverse measurements such as temperature? The limitations stem from inherent trade-offs related to the sensor designs. For example, better quality spatial and multispectral data on satellites would compete for onboard data storage space, as well as data transmission requirements to communicate with ground stations (CIESIN 1993). To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, solutions such as having a larger pixel size or accepting light from a wider spectral interval can be used, but will result in a decrease in spatial and spectral resolution respectively (Jia et al. 2022).\nGiven that no perfect satellite exists currently, it ultimately depends on one’s research needs and what to prioritise. MODIS which has 36 bands, can be used to study dust clouds because its bands 29-32 are able to track dust aerosols and it has a temporal resolution of one day (Boroughani et al. 2021). However, it has medium spatial resolution at 250m, 500m and 1000m depending on the band. . On the other hand, a study of land use changes over time probably does not require daily satellite images but perhaps at a monthly interval. However, higher spatial resolution to distinguish finer details to observe changes in the pattern would be essential. A table of some commonly used satellite sensors as below compiled shows some of the tradeoffs between the various resolutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview of some commonly used satellite sensors. Source: Liang and Wang (2020)\nAnother thing that struck me is how big the remote sensing data is. Processing and saving in SNAP, followed by running the spectral signatures in R took quite a fair bit of waiting time as a result. I had flashbacks to my undergraduate days waiting in the lab for some remote sensing results to process on ENVI and ArcGIS. Hence, the Google Earth Engine segment would be something to look forward to given it runs on cloud computing resources and will be able to handle geospatial data compared to my personal device. I was also reminded of the recent AGI GeoCom 2023 on the ‘Environmental Impacts of Earth Observation in the Constellation and Cloud Computing Era’ presentation (Wilkinson et al. 2024). The central idea was that considering the substantial file size of remote sensing data and the fact that not all data is essential, it may be worthwhile to reassess the necessity of storing all available datasets. This is especially so due to the environmental implications associated with the storage of large datasets in data centers.\n\n\n\n\nAhady, Abdul Baqi, and Gordana Kaplan. 2022. “Classification Comparison of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Data in Google Earth Engine, Study Case of the City of Kabul.” International Journal of Engineering and Geosciences 7 (1): 24–31. https://doi.org/10.26833/ijeg.860077.\n\n\nAstola, Heikki, Tuomas Häme, Laura Sirro, Matthieu Molinier, and Jorma Kilpi. 2019. “Comparison of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 Imagery for Forest Variable Prediction in Boreal Region.” Remote Sensing of Environment 223: 257–73. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.01.019.\n\n\nBoroughani, Mahdi, Sima Pourhashemi, Hamid Gholami, and Dimitris G Kaskaoutis. 2021. “Predicting of Dust Storm Source by Combining Remote Sensing, Statistic-Based Predictive Models and Game Theory in the Sistan Watershed, Southwestern Asia.” Journal of Arid Land 13: 1103–21. https://doi.org/10.1007/s40333-021-0023-3.\n\n\nCastaldi, Fabio. 2021. “Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 Multi-Temporal Series to Estimate Topsoil Properties on Croplands.” Remote Sensing 13 (17). https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13173345.\n\n\nCIESIN. 1993. “Box 4-b–System Tradeoffs.” http://www.ciesin.org/docs/005-356/box4B.html#:~:tet=Sensor%20design%20requires%20tradeoffs%20among,at%20the%20expense%20of%20another.\n\n\nGIS Geography. 2023. “What Is Remote Sensing?
